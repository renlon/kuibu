# A2A vs MCP: Understanding Google's New Agent-to-Agent Protocol

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI agents, Google recently released a significant new standard at [Google Cloud Next '25](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/welcome-to-google-cloud-next25): the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This open protocol represents a major step toward creating interoperable AI systems that can collaborate effectively. Let's explore what A2A is, how it compares to Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), and what this means for the future of AI agents.

## What is A2A?

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is an open protocol introduced by Google that standardizes how AI agents communicate with each other. At its core, A2A enables agents to:

- Securely **exchange information** between different agents
- Coordinate actions **across platforms and vendors**
- **Discover other agents' capabilities** through standardized "Agent Cards"
- Manage tasks with **state tracking and real-time updates**

The protocol is built on existing standards including HTTP, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and JSON-RPC, making it relatively easy to integrate with existing IT infrastructure.

A key component of A2A is the "Agent Card" - a JSON format document that advertises an agent's capabilities, including:
- Hosted/DNS information
- Version information
- Skills and capabilities available

## Why Did Google Create A2A?

Google's motivation for developing A2A stems from the recognition that AI is moving toward ecosystems of specialized agents that need to work together. [According to Google's announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/):

> "To maximize the benefits from agentic AI, it is critical for these agents to be able to collaborate in a dynamic, multi-agent ecosystem across siloed data systems and applications."

The company's intention appears to be creating a standard that enables:

1. **Interoperability**: Allowing agents from different vendors to communicate seamlessly
2. **Scalability**: Making it easier to build complex, multi-agent systems
3. **Standardization**: Providing a common language for agent interactions
4. **Enterprise adoption**: Making it easier for businesses to implement agent networks

With over 50 partners including major companies like Atlassian, Box, and Salesforce, Google is positioning A2A as an industry standard rather than a proprietary solution.

## What Problems Does A2A Solve?

A2A addresses several critical challenges in building effective agent systems:

### 1. Agent Discovery and Selection

Without a standard protocol, finding and selecting the right agent for a task is difficult. A2A creates a discovery mechanism through Agent Cards that list capabilities, allowing client agents to identify the most suitable remote agent for a specific task.

### 2. Cross-Platform Communication

Agents often exist in different environments, built by different teams using different frameworks. A2A provides a standardized communication layer so agents can work together regardless of how they were built.

### 3. Coordination of Long-Running Tasks

Many agent tasks aren't instantaneous and may require updates over time. A2A includes mechanisms for task management, state tracking, and notifications for long-running operations.

### 4. Security Concerns

A2A is designed with security in mind, supporting enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, with parity to OpenAPI's authentication schemes.

### 5. User Experience Negotiation

A2A enables agents to negotiate about UI capabilities, allowing them to determine what kind of content (text, images, iframes, etc.) can be displayed to users.

## A2A vs. MCP: Complementary Standards

A key question in the AI community is whether A2A **competes with** or **complements** Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). Based on Google's positioning and the design of both protocols, they appear to **serve different but complementary purposes:**

### MCP (Model Context Protocol):
- **Focus**: Connecting models/LLMs with tools and external data sources
- **Direction**: Model-to-tool communication
- **Purpose**: Providing context and capabilities to a single model/agent
- **Analogy**: Your personal toolbox that an agent uses to interact with the world

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent):
![A2A and MCP Relationship](https://google.github.io/A2A/images/a2a_mcp.png)

- **Focus**: Communication between intelligent agents
- **Direction**: Agent-to-agent communication
- **Purpose**: Coordination between multiple intelligent systems
- **Analogy**: A team of specialists collaborating, each with their own toolbox

Google explicitly positions A2A as complementary to MCP in their [documentation](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/a2a_and_mcp), with a page titled "A2A ❤️ MCP." They explain the relationship using a car repair example:

> "MCP is the protocol to connect agents with their structured tools (e.g. 'raise platform by 2 meters', 'turn wrench 4 mm to the right')."

> "A2A is the protocol that enables end-users or other agents to work with the shop employees ('my car is making a rattling noise'). A2A enables ongoing back-and-forth communication and an evolving plan to achieve results."

## Practical Example: Travel Planning

Let's consider a real-world scenario that illustrates the difference between MCP and A2A:

### Using Only MCP:

You have a single AI assistant that needs to book a trip to Hawaii:

1. The assistant uses MCP to access a flight search tool
2. The assistant queries the tool for flight options
3. The assistant uses MCP to access a hotel booking tool
4. The assistant queries for hotel availability
5. The assistant uses MCP to access a car rental tool
6. The assistant presents all information to you and takes booking actions

The single assistant handles everything using various tools.

### Using A2A + MCP:

1. You tell your personal assistant agent you want to plan a Hawaii trip
2. Your assistant uses A2A to discover and communicate with specialized travel agents:
   - A flight booking agent (which uses MCP to access airline APIs)
   - A hotel booking agent (which uses MCP to access hotel inventory)
   - A car rental agent (which uses MCP to access rental car availability)
3. These specialized agents collaborate through A2A to coordinate dates and preferences
4. Each specialized agent handles its domain using MCP to control its specific tools
5. Your personal assistant collects the results and presents a complete travel plan

In this scenario, MCP handles the "agent-to-tool" communication, while A2A manages the "agent-to-agent" coordination.

## The Future: A2A and MCP Together

Rather than competing, A2A and MCP address different layers of the agent ecosystem:

- **MCP**: The protocol for how agents use tools and access data
- **A2A**: The protocol for how agents collaborate with each other

Together, they could form the foundation of a truly interconnected agent ecosystem where specialized AI systems work together seamlessly.

This doesn't mean the relationship is without tension. As Solomon Hykes (CEO of Dagger, ex-Docker) [pointed out](https://x.com/solomonstre/status/1909983975243661768):

> "In theory they can coexist, in practice I foresee a tug of war. Developers can only invest their energy into so many ecosystems."

The future will likely be determined by adoption, developer experience, and which protocol (or combination of protocols) proves most effective in real-world implementations.

## Conclusion

Google's A2A protocol represents a significant step toward creating interconnected, collaborative AI agent systems. Rather than replacing Anthropic's MCP, A2A appears to complement it by addressing agent-to-agent communication while MCP handles agent-to-tool interactions.

As these protocols mature and gain adoption, we may be witnessing the early infrastructure of what Google calls "the internet of agents" – a future where AI systems communicate and collaborate to solve complex problems across platforms, vendors, and domains.

For developers and organizations building agent systems today, understanding the distinct roles of both protocols will be crucial to building effective, interoperable AI solutions.
