title:  The Evolution of Search - From Keywords to Knowledge Graphs
tags:  
---
In the mid-1990s, if you wanted to find something on the internet, you'd likely use a search engine like AltaVista. Type in your keywords, and you'd get thousands of results to sift through manually. This was the "AltaVista effect" – while getting zero results was no longer a problem, having too many irrelevant results became the new challenge. Fast forward to today, and we're witnessing a revolutionary transformation in how we search and retrieve information, with knowledge graphs emerging as a game-changing technology.

## The Google Revolution: Beyond Simple Text Matching

Google's breakthrough came with PageRank, a graph algorithm that fundamentally changed how search results were ranked. Instead of just matching keywords, PageRank analyzed the web's link structure to determine the importance and relevance of pages. This was the first major step away from pure text-based search, leading to Google's dominance in the search market.

In 2012, Google took another leap forward by introducing its Knowledge Graph, shifting from "strings to things." Rather than treating search terms as mere text strings, the Knowledge Graph understands real-world entities and their relationships. When you search for something today, you often see a knowledge panel on the right side of your results, combining structured data with traditional web content.

## Enter GraphRAG: The Marriage of Knowledge Graphs and AI

As we move into the era of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, a new approach called GraphRAG is emerging as the next evolution in search technology. GraphRAG combines the structured understanding of knowledge graphs with the power of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Recent research has shown that this combination can dramatically improve search accuracy. For example, a study by data.world found that question-answering systems using knowledge graphs achieved three times higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches. Microsoft Research has also demonstrated that GraphRAG can help solve two critical challenges:

1. Connecting disparate pieces of information through their relationships
2. Understanding holistic concepts across large collections of documents

## Why Knowledge Graphs Matter

Knowledge graphs provide crucial context that helps reduce AI hallucinations and improve answer accuracy. Think of it like this: traditional search looks at individual pieces of information in isolation, while knowledge graphs understand how everything is connected. This context is especially valuable for enterprise applications, where understanding complex relationships between data points is critical.

A real-world example of this improvement can be seen in insurance data analysis, where systems using knowledge graphs achieved 54.2% accuracy compared to just 16.7% for traditional approaches. This dramatic improvement comes from the system's ability to understand not just individual data points, but how claims, policies, payments, and other entities relate to each other.

## The Future of Search

As we look ahead, the combination of knowledge graphs, large language models, and retrieval-augmented generation promises to revolutionize how we interact with information. Instead of just finding documents that might contain our answer, these systems can:

- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Understand complex relationships between entities
- Provide more accurate and contextual responses
- Maintain provenance of information
- Reduce AI hallucinations through grounding in structured knowledge

The evolution from keyword matching to knowledge graphs represents a fundamental shift in how we organize and retrieve information. As these technologies continue to mature, we're moving closer to systems that truly understand the meaning behind our questions and can provide accurate, contextual answers drawn from vast knowledge networks.

This transformation isn't just about better search results – it's about building systems that can reason about information in ways that more closely mirror human understanding. As we continue to build and refine these technologies, we're getting closer to search systems that don't just find information, but truly help us understand it.
## About PageRank
PageRank is one of Google's oldest algorithms, developed in 1996, that measures webpage importance based on the quality and quantity of incoming links. Key points include:

1. Core Concepts:

- Treats links as votes for webpage importance
- Uses a logarithmic scale (previously 0-10)
- Values both quality and quantity of backlinks
- Remains important in 2024 despite public scores being removed

2. Historical Timeline:

- 1998: Initial development and patent filing
- 2000: Google Toolbar launch
- 2016: Google Toolbar retirement
- 2024: Leaked documents reveal multiple PageRank versions still in use

3. Current Status:

- Multiple versions exist internally:
    - RawPageRank
    - PageRank2
    - PageRank_NS
    - FirstCoveragePageRank

4. Influencing Factors:

- Anchor text
- Link click likelihood
- Internal linking
- Nofollow links
- Homepage PageRank

5. Modern Relevance:

- Still used by Google for assessing webpage authority
- Helps determine link value
- Guides website structure understanding
- Alternative metrics like Semrush's Authority Score now help SEOs measure site authority

6. Improvement Strategies:

- Focus on quality backlinks
- Implement strategic internal linking
- Use outreach and guest blogging
- Engage in broken link building
- Become a source for media
