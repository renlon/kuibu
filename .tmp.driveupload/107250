## Data augmentation
data augmentation refers to the process of artificially increasing the amount of training data by creating modified versions of existing data points. For language models, this could involve techniques such as:

1. Synonym replacement: Substituting words with their synonyms.
2. Back-translation: Translating text to another language and back.
3. Text paraphrasing: Rewriting sentences to convey the same meaning differently.
4. Adding noise: Introducing random changes or errors to the text.

The purpose of augmentation is to:

1. Increase the diversity of the training data.
2. Improve model generalization and robustness.
3. Reduce overfitting, especially when working with limited datasets.

When discussing token count in relation to augmentation, it typically means the number of tokens in the dataset after applying augmentation techniques. This count would be higher than the original dataset, as augmentation creates additional variations of the existing data
