What is the relationship between tools and resources?
how does server expose tools to client?
how does server expose prompt template to client?
how does client interpret user query and form a tool calling request
It was mentioned that we can dynamically create tools based on available API specs. Does it mean using LLM to create tool definition in the flight? is that a common practice?
how does client side perform server discovery behind the scene? by reading the local config of the available tools and resources and start sending the request that the tool/resource expects to the ports that MCP server listens to?
assuming there is a syntax/schema requirement for tool definition?
