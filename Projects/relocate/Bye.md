After 9 incredible years at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-web-services/) (and a little more hesitation than I care to admit 😅), I've closed my laptop one last time. Writing posts like these always feels a bit cheesy, but after nearly a decade I can’t step off this rollercoaster without expressing gratitude.  
  
Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with some of the most brilliant minds in the industry in the AWS Support and AWS Solutions Architecture orgs, including SMB SA and Partner SA teams. Each role a unique chapter filled with countless lessons and experiences that have shaped me both personally and professionally.  
  
On a personal note, [Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/) has been a source of immense growth—not just for me, but also my family. Over these years, I’ve gone from a naïve single guy with plenty of free time to a (hopefully slightly-less-naïve) married father of two—with another on the way! AWS also gave my family the incredible opportunity to settle in the U.S.—a privilege we’ll always treasure.  
  
To my fellow Amazonians: Thank you! I’ve been overwhelmed by the messages and memories, many accompanied by photos I hadn’t seen in years—whether it was hiring events in Brazil, SME bootcamps in Dublin, walking our feet off in Vegas at re:Invent, cheering for the Stormers at Newlands Stadium, Axe throwing in Chicago, or team socials on a yacht in Cape Town. AWS truly hires great people, and I’m constantly inspired by the brilliance, passion, and drive everyone has.  
  
Beyond colleagues, I also want to express my gratitude to all the AWS Customers/Partners I had the privilege of working with. You’re building some of the coolest stuff out there! Thank you for allowing me to collaborate with your teams—it’s been a privilege to witness your growth and success across so many industries. I look forward to watching you thrive during this fascinating time.  
  
The tech world is small, so I know this is simply “see ya later!”. I feel energized by the relationships built—many of which I’m proud to call friends.  
  
As for what’s next, I’m thrilled to share I’ll be joining [Glean](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gleanwork/)! They’re building the best, most user-friendly, search-enabled, permissions-aware, feature-rich, and enterprise-ready Work AI platform out there (and that’s saying something!).  
  
Joining Glean was a deliberate decision after extensive (AI-augmented, of course 😉) research. I’m excited to join a team with superstars and deeply experienced leaders. This move offers the opportunity to take on greater challenges, and make a more direct impact in building something new. I’ll share more soon about why I have high conviction Glean will be one of the biggest stories in AI.  
  
For now, I’m fortunate to have a couple of days to reset, learn new things, unlearn old habits, and immerse myself in Glean’s content. I’m loving the stories about why so many great companies are quickly choosing Glean. After that, it’s back to being "the dumbest person in the room” 😅 as I learn from the incredible team they’ve built. I can’t wait! 😁
